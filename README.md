This web application explores the dataset `vehicles_us.csv`. This project contains the following visualizations:

- Data viewer
- Vehicle `condition` by `manufacturer`
- `Sum of sales` by vehicle `condition`
- Vehicle `price` and `condition` comparison
- Price distribution of `fuel` type by `transmission`
- Price distribution of `4WD` vs. `non-4WD` by `transmission`
- `Price` and `days listed` distribution

*Note* Regarding scatter plots:
- Trendline is set to `expanding` mean trend.
- Trendline scope is set to `overall`.

# Summary and Analysis

- The top two manufacturers with the most sales were `Ford` and `Chevrolet` (histograms: `Vehicle types by manufacturer` and `Vehicle condtion by manufacturer`)
- The conditions with the most sales came from `excellent` and `good` vehicles (`Total sales by vehicle condition` histogram). 
- `2013` models sold the most (`Histogram of condition vs model_year`).
- There is an inverse correlation between the vehicle `price` and `days listed`.
